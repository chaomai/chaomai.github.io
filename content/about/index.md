# About Me & This Site

I am interested in C++, Golang, Rust, concurrent programming, and distributed systems. I am curious about how things work and am eager to understand their nature and the connections between them. In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, photography, and playing video games. Additionally, I am a big fan of road trips and love driving on long journeys.

This is a repository of my life: a place for the things I've experienced, learned, built, and wasted time on.

# About Photography

My journey in photography is probably similar to most people’s. I started with an APS-C camera, but then heard from friends and online sources that full-frame cameras were superior. After taking only a few shots, I upgraded to a full-frame body. Then I realized that full-frame lenses are not only expensive but also bulky. So, I started wondering what to upgrade to next. I came across a term on Reddit that perfectly describes people like this: GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome) – the belief that better equipment will automatically make one a better photographer.

But I still love photography, keep learning, and enjoy capturing beautiful moments. The emotional value of upgrading my gear is also something I appreciate.
